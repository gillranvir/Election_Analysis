## Summary
The script and tools used provides a highly scalable template for rapid analysis and presentation of voting data. The benefit lies within the speed and efficiency demonstrated for crunching massive data sources exceeding several hundred thousand rows of a spreasheet which could otherwise prove time consuming and resource heavy.

With minor modifications, the script can be repurposed for several other scenarios as well, for example:
1. Counties could be replaced by States when assessing a General Election
2. Further calculation could be added to show the winner's lead over the trailing contestant
